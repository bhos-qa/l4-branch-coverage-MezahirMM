# CODE COVERAGE
Code Coverage is a method to learn what percentage of the main code is analyzed by the tests. In my research and from the prior lectures, I have learnt about different types of code coverage. 
## Line Coverage 
It is a method that measures how many lines of the code the code executed in the testing process. It is usually considered the least useful method of code coverage. 
## Statement Coverage
In this method, it is analyzed that how many statements are covered in the tests. It is overall a better metric because line coverage does not take into account that there can be multiple statements in one line. 
## Branch Coverage
It is a method that tells us if all the branches in a repository are covered by the tests. Branch coverage is a subset of code coverage as it is a more specialized version of code coverage that focuses on a specific aspect which is ensuring that every branch or path is tested.
